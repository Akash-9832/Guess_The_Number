# Guess_The_Number
**Programming Language: Java**


Developed a game where the computer generates a random number, and the user tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts.
The program will provide hints if the user's guess is higher or lower than the target number. If the user guesses the correct number within the allowed attempts, they win; otherwise, the game ends, and the correct number is revealed.
